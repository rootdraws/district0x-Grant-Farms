<h3><b>Introduction: Bootstrapping the Grant Farms</b></h3>

In November '20, I made a number of sale passes with my <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/alice">ALICE NFT Collection</a>. 

The proposal was that I would take all profits from the sale, and redirect those profits into grant related challenges for that community. I used Opensea's 24 Hour Bid Sale, because it is gas efficient, and allows you to switch currencies to target communities.

The price was increased each round, based on 1/10th the value of the Liquid Grant Funds accumulated: 

* Round 1: $ETH - 1.2325 $ETH was raised for the Grant. 
* Round 2: $SKULL - 7360 $SKULL was raised for the Grant. 
* Round 3: $BAEPAY - 3600 $BAEPAY was raised for the Grant. 
* Round 4: $KLTR - 450 $KLTR was raised for the Grant.

My Costs were approximated to .02 $ETH per NFT Sold. These investments will be recovered over time. 
I've also secured a Beta Access to Opensea's ERC - 1155 minter and contract creator, which means that costs for future experiments will be dramatically lowered.

Then I matched the the $ETH from the Grant, into the [$SKULL | $BAEPAY | $KLTR] to form Liquidity Pairs, creating <a href="https://beta.cent.co/rootdraws/+atk5fn">"Grant Farms".</a>

Grant Farms were created using separate wallets with unique seeds. The <b>LP Tokens, Liquid Grant Balances,</b> and any <b>NFT rewards</b> are distributed to their respective Farms, and all balances are transparent here: 

* <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeC346627bA83b471d5ab171618274c5333F9f37">$SKULL Grant Farm</a>
* <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xE476C37a862c6603D3179Aa8b10114590Dc1fcfe">$BAEPAY Grant Farm</a> 
* <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x77B0F6AB601C6a5B0741CD5B977BB1AaA1794e3e">$KLTR Grant Farm.</a>

This allows me to build and manage the Grant Fund for each community as an investment portfolio, where the source for the grants are the LP Rewards, and the principle investment can be continuously built using a profit share model for future collection sales.
