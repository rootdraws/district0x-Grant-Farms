<h3><b>Use Case #1: A Gardener Grows & Manages their $BAEPAY Community Garden Plot.</b></h3>

$BAEPAY has a number of assets for their business: 

* They Have <a href="https://www.fomamag.com/">FOMA Mag</a>, which is an excellent indie run publication. 
* They have an extensive <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=N@187W,103N">Cryptovoxels Gallery</a>.
* They have a regular email newsletter with interviews on highlighted artists. 
* They have a platform with a marketplace - <a href="https://www.blockchainartexchange.co.uk/">Blockchain Art Exchange [BAE]</a>.
* They have their own Currency, with <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa14c40b83885e1f8d516e0e43a7361f31eca6854#balances">Liquidity Providers.</a> 
* They offer their Liquiditiy Providers Rewards <a href="https://blockchainartex.medium.com/baepay-the-first-real-reward-token-b23b10c96965">outlined in this whitepaper.</a>

BAE still suffers from: 

* Lack of adoption of their platform, in the face of competition with major platforms.
* Lack of financial support for their marketing endeavors. 
* Lack of stability in their Uniswap Pools. 

<a href="SaschaBailey">Sascha Bailey</a> is offering Liquidty Provider Rewards each month for the next ~ 2 years to combat these issues. This is an opportunity for investors to contribute to the <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xa14c40b83885e1f8d516e0e43a7361f31eca6854">Uniswap BAEPAY - ETH Pool.</a> 

In return for providing this Liquidity, Sascha's Avatar, <a href="https://twitter.com/baepaychan">@baepaychan</a>, distributes:
* 20,000 $BAEPAY each week, proportionately to all $BAEPAY Pools, and then proportionately to the Liquidity Providers in the Pool.
* A little bit of ETH Each Month to the top 15 Slots in the Liquidity Provider Holder Hierarchy. 
* The Occasional Rare NFT.

A "Community Garden Plot" is simply a separate wallet with its own keys that has made a contribution to the BAEPAY - ETH liquidity pool, such that the "Harvest" from this contribution consists of as many LP Rewards as possible from that garden. At the time of my writing this, I have created a <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xE476C37a862c6603D3179Aa8b10114590Dc1fcfe">$BAEPAY Grant Farm</a> which qualifies for all three of those rewards. 

This means that the assets that I am able to use for my $BAEPAY Community Challenges [The Harvest], is <b>a weekly deposit of $BAEPAY, a monthly $ETH Deposit,</b> and <b>some NFTs.</b> 

<h3>Scaling this Solution:</h3> 

DeFi Community Gardens, is a District0x themed community support project, which aims to support projects by training artists to become Community Gardeners, invested in growing the liqudity pools of projects of their choosing, while simultaniously organizing community challenges and art collections for those projects. 

A <b>Grant Farm</b> is a purposeful contribution toward a project's Liquidity Pool, designed to leverage liquidity provider rewards as grant funds for community challenges.

The way it works is simple: 

An Artist [or Community Gardener] looks at BAE, and thinks of a community event that would benefit the $BAEPAY Holders, and then organizes one. 

A community challenge that I will be organizing in February is a Challenge to create a small comic about their avatar, <a href="https://twitter.com/baepaychan">@baepaychan</a>, and use the sales from that NFT Collection to help grow my own $BAEPAY Grant Farm.  

This event is designed by a Community Gardener as a challenge that they lead, where they design an NFT Collection meant to be sold via Opensea using $BAEPAY [or any ERC-20 Project Token].

Depending on the amount of resources that this Community Gardener has to share [the size of their plots], they can afford to offer up different amounts of rewards as incentives for joining challenge. 

[These are the LP Rewards distributed weekly, based on the size of the Garden Plot.]

The Community Challenges are Executed. 
A Substancial amount of profits are channeled into the Grant Farm, and the Community Gardener gets to take a small harvest as well.  
* [Ex: 30% Profits to Artist. 70% profits go back into that Gardener's $BAEPAY Community Garden Plot.]

Then, It's onto the next challenge - Either for $BAEPAY, or for another project that the Gardener is passionate about -- and all the while, each plot that the Gardener maintains continues to grow, as long as the Liquidity Provider Reward Agreements are honored, or until they expire. 

<h3> Outcomes:</h3>

<b>The Outcomes for the Artist:</b>

* The Artist builds skills for project management and execution. 
* The Artist builds a collector base, and involves them in a project goal larger than themselves.
* The Artist switches their production focus from unfocused one-off NFTs, toward project focused, audience targeted, NFT Collections. 
* The Artist diversifys their token portfolio, and learns what it means to be an institutional investor, working on behalf of, other projects in the ecosystem that they deem to be worthy of support. 
* The Artist benefits from a pro-social Wash Trading, where their collections can actually be purchased by the leaders of the projects that they are serving. 

If a project has a budget for purchasing NFTs for liquidity rewards, or a budget for Marketing - [most of them do] - this use case fulfills both of those criterea, which means that it's an easy sell for the controller of the currency for that project, and a win for the artists who do public fundraising rounds, and get to announce increased sales and partnerships.

<b>The Outcomes for Collectors:</b>

* Instead of endless artsits dropping "Hot #Cryptoart NFTs", sales are now seen as community contributions, which allows collectors in the ETH Market to plug into that artist, because they also support the causes which the artist is raising funds to support.
* If I am invested in $BAEPAY, and an artist comes along and says, "I'm creating a challenge event for $BAEPAY, and X% of profits are going to be channeled into a Community Garden Plot which funds furture Challenges!" -- I am going to interpret what that artist is doing as someone who is adding value to the ecosystem, and to that project. 
* Collectors in ETH Cryptoart are attracted to innovative applications for cryptoart -- if an artist is seen as a community support figure, and an innovator, perhaps their speculative investment in that NFT they bought will appreciate. 


<b>The Outcomes for the Project:</b>

* The Project is distributing these liquidity rewards anyways. In this way, they are distributing them toward an account that actually wants to leverage them for the benefit of their community. 
* The Project recieves a 'pillar of support', as long as the liquidity rewards are being distributed to the grant - because the incentive for the grant farms is not to cash out liquidity when the market is high. the function of the grant farms is to harvest the LP Rewards, which are the dividends of the initial investment. 

This ought to motivate token issuers to generate compelling, and tiered LP rewards, in order to incentivize Gardeners to Grow their Plots, in order to unlock higher LP rewards. 

* In the ultimate case of a highly successful challenge, we have the $LINK Marines effect, where a wave of cryptoart overtake the social presence of the moment, feuling a FOMO Craze, which PROPELLS the whole community TO THE MOON. 

Well Done Gardeners, this is the equivolant of the <b>Super Pumpkin</b>.

[Of course, in smaller segments, this may also be possible just by introducing more quality artists [marketers] and collectors [investors] to their community via the challenge.]

[And in the line of "Super Pumpkin" I think awards can be issued for meeting certain milestones in project achievement.]

<h3><b>Use Case #2: A Gardener Grows & Manages their $SKULL Community Garden Plot, while Seeding the META Garden.</b></h3>

In order to Participate in the District0x Community Gardens, each gardner will need to contribute a small percentage of ETH and the currency of their latest Harvest to the <b>META Garden.</b>

The META Garden is a DAO Governed Treasury made up of Liquidity Pools with Active LP Reward Systems. The variety of Liquidity Pools will be as many different varieties as there are plots in the larger garden. 

Once a year, the META Garden is harvested, and we celebrate the <b>Harvest Festival!</b>

<b>Example:</b>

Root Cultivates his <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeC346627bA83b471d5ab171618274c5333F9f37">$SKULL Community Garden Plot</a> with 8 Harvests a year.
Each Harvest, he contributes more to the Plot, growing it in size, and maybe even qualifying for greater $SKULL LP Rewards. <a href="https://beta.cent.co/skeenee/+hhaemj" -- Oct '20 $SKULL Report details LP Reward levels for $SKULL Pools.</a>

Each time Root has a harvest, he knows that seeding the META Garden is important, because each year during the <b>HARVEST FESTIVAL</b>, the Yield from the META Garden is used to support a challeng focused on creating Creative Commons Zero Artwork designed to support GITCOIN / GITCOIN projects. 

What this essentially means, is that each art community that is being lead in challenges by a Community Gardener, will be targeting their community funds, as rewards, for participating in a GITCOIN Focused Challenge. 

The Harvest Festival is a great mythic time, where the Hero Slays Moloch, God of Coordination Failure.  

Over time, the META Garden will increase in size and capacity, essentially providing yet another pillar of stability to each of these projects that provide Liquidity Rewards, and due to the collective nature of the META Garden, that 20 ETH Liquidity Reward for the SKULL - ETH Pool may become a bit more within reach.

<h3><b>Use Case #3 EcoSystem Integrations: In Which GITCOIN Requests a ROBOT!!!.</b></h3>

In March, Root Organizes for the #MARCHOFROBOTS Twitter Challenge, and LO AND BEHOLD, <a href="https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1330658059396399104">a collection of Creative Commons Zero Robots</a> is created.

As you can see in the linked Tweet above, there is a demand for CC0 Robots.

If Root also leverages his <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x77B0F6AB601C6a5B0741CD5B977BB1AaA1794e3e">$KLTR Community Garden Plot!</a>, then perhaps he can create a community challenge that motivates other artists to create collections of CC0 Robots. 

<a href="https://twitter.com/owocki">@Owocki</a> is thrilled. 
The Market is FLOODED with CC0 Robots, and GITCOIN gets the pick of the litter, along with the ability to use them for training modules, reward NFTs, or Cute T-Shirts to support the GITCOIN Mission. 

Gold stars for all of you. 

Also, Gitcoin Grant Matching for the event. So in addition to any funds raised from the profits of the NFT Collection, 
[70% of Profits is Donated to the GITCOIN Campaign of the Artist's Choice. 30% of Profits go to Artist?]

AND the $KLTR Grant Incentive from the $KLTR Plot. 

Maybe a GITCOIN GRANT is distributed for that round to match the KLTR Grant offer - which then distributes some love to the challengers and there were many happy robots. 

In the case of the <b>HARVEST FESTIVAL</b>, something similar could occure.

<h3><b>Use Case #4 EcoSystem Integrations: Okay, but what if they were GAardeners...your Aavegotchi could be like a little Community GAardener!!!.</b></h3>

* This works well, because it's another point of connection to a healthy community -- Which Aavegotchi supports.
* It fits with the pro-social ethos of Aavegotchi, and the Defi ethos of Aave. 
* And Aavegotchis have land coming up -- we really ought to be able to build community gardens on that land for these Grant Projects. 

I see this as a longer term development possibility, but I think it's cool, and I like how Aavegotchis can be used to transmit value in NFTs. They are basically little NFT Tradable Grant Farms.
