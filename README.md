<h3><b>Use Case #1: A Gardener Grows & Manages their $BAEPAY Community Garden.</b></h3>

$BAEPAY has a number of assets for their business: 

* They Have <a href="https://www.fomamag.com/">FOMA Mag</a>, which is an excellent indie run publication. 
* They have an extensive <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=N@187W,103N">Cryptovoxels Gallery</a>.
* They have a regular email newsletter with interviews on highlighted artists. 
* They have a platform with a marketplace - <a href="https://www.blockchainartexchange.co.uk/">Blockchain Art Exchange [BAE]</a>.
* They have their own Currency, with <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa14c40b83885e1f8d516e0e43a7361f31eca6854#balances">Liquidity Providers.</a> 
* They offer their Liquiditiy Providers Rewards <a href="https://blockchainartex.medium.com/baepay-the-first-real-reward-token-b23b10c96965">outlined in this whitepaper.</a>

BAE still suffers from: 

* Lack of adoption of their platform, in the face of competition with major platforms.
* Lack of financial support for their marketing endeavors. 
* Lack of stability in their Uniswap Pools. 

<a href="SaschaBailey">Sascha Bailey</a> is offering Liquidty Provider Rewards each month for the next ~ 2 years to combat these issues. This is an opportunity for investors to contribute to the <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xa14c40b83885e1f8d516e0e43a7361f31eca6854">Uniswap BAEPAY - ETH Pool.</a> 

In return for providing this Liquidity, <a href="https://twitter.com/baepaychan">@BaepayChan</a> Distributes a percentage of 20,000 $BAEPAY each Week <a href="https://blockchainartex.medium.com/baepay-the-first-real-reward-token-b23b10c96965" (until approximately January 2022.)</a> -- as well as a bit of ETH each month if you are one of the top 15 Liquidity Providers. 

[At the time of writing this, I am a top 15 Liquidity Provider, and I have only provided ~.5 ETH worth of Liquidity for my $BAEPAY Grant Farm.] 

This means that while the project is committed in itself, the $BAEPAY financial structure could use strengthening - and DeFi Community Gardens can help.  

<h3>Solution:</h3> 
DeFi Community Gardens, is a District0x themed community support project, which aims to support projects by training artists to become Community Gardeners, offering support to their own plots of "Grant Farms". 

A <b>Grant Farm</b> is a purposeful contribution toward a project's Liquidity Pool, designed to leverage liquidity provider rewards as grant funds for community challenges.

The way it works is simple: 

An Artist [or Community Gardener] looks at BAE, and thinks of a community event that would benefit the $BAEPAY Holders, and then organizes one. 

An example of this could be a community challenge to create a small comic about their avatar, <a href="https://twitter.com/baepaychan">@BAEPAYChan</a>, and use the sales from that NFT Collection to raise assets for a $BAEPAY Community Garden Plot. 

This event is designed by that Community Gardener as a challenge that they lead, where they design an NFT Collection meant to be sold via Opensea using $BAEPAY [or any ERC-20 Project Token].

Depending on the amount of resources that this Community Gardener has to share [the size of their plots], they can afford to offer up different amounts of rewards as incentives for joining challenge. 

[These are the LP Rewards distributed weekly, based on the size of the Garden Plot.]

The Community Challenges are Executed. 
A Substancial amount of profits are channeled into the Grant Farm, and the Community Gardener gets to take a small harvest as well.  
* [Ex: 30% Profits to Artist. 70% profits go back into that Gardener's $BAEPAY Community Garden Plot.]

<h3> Outcomes:</h3>

<b>The Outcomes for the Artist:</b>

* The Artist builds skills for project management and execution. 
* The Artist builds a collector base, and involves them in a project goal larger than themselves.
* The Artist switches their production focus from unfocused one-off NFTs, toward project focused, audience targeted, NFT Collections. 
* The Artist diversifis their token portfolio, and learns what it means to be an institutional investor, working on behalf of, other projects in the ecosystem that they deem to be worthy of support. 
* The Artist benefits from a pro-social Wash Trading, where their collections can actually be purchased by the leaders of the projects that they are serving. 

If a project has a budget for purchasing NFTs for liquidity rewards, or a budget for Marketing - [most of them do] - this use case fulfills both of those criterea, which means that the artists can instill a sense of value into their work due to increased sales volume during fundraising periods.

<b>The Outcomes for Collectors:</b>

* Instead of endless artsits dropping "Hot #Cryptoart NFTs", sales are now seen as community contributions, which allows collectors in the ETH Market to plug into that artist, because they also support the causes which the artist is raising funds to support.
* If I am invested in $BAEPAY, and an artist comes along and says, "I'm creating a challenge event for $BAEPAY, and X% of profits are going to be channeled into a Community Garden Plot which funds furture Challenges!" -- I am going to interpret what that artist is doing as someone who is adding value to the ecosystem, and to that project. 
* Collectors in ETH Cryptoart are attracted to innovative applications for cryptoart -- if an artist is seen as a community support figure, and an innovator, perhaps their speculative investment in that NFT they bought will appreciate. 


<b>The Outcomes for the Project:</b>

* The Project is distributing these liquidity rewards anyways. In this way, they are distributing them toward an account that actually wants to leverage them for the benefit of their community. 
* The Project recieves a 'pillar of support', as long as the liquidity rewards are being distributed to the grant - because the incentive for the grant farms is not to cash out liquidity when the market is high. the function of the grant farms is to access the LP Rewards, which enable the 
* In the ultimate case of a highly successful challenge, we have the $LINK Marines effect, where a wave of memes overtakes the social presence, and precipitates notice, which fuels a craze, and then everyone on that project is propelled TO THE MOON. 

[Of course, in smaller segments, this may also be possible just by introducing more quality artists [marketers] and collectors [investors] to their community via the challenge.]
