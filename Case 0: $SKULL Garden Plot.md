<h3><b>Use Case #0: A Gardener Grows & Manages their $SKULL Community Garden Plot using a Kickstarter Community Challenge!</b></h3> [JAN: 2021]

$SKULL Introduced <a href="https://beta.cent.co/skeenee/+mr2ow2">Liquidity Mining</a> officially in Dec '20, but they have been offering a DIY version through the $SKULL Discord, and announcements on Cent.

$SKULL is also a leader in the <a href="https://tryroll.com/">ROLL Community</a>, and they featured an announcement of $SKULL's Liquidity Rewards in their most recent <a href="https://mailchi.mp/86252b8beae0/roll-update-6103385">Newsletter</a>. I am informed that Roll will be issuing a Liquidity Mining tool in Q1 of 2021, which means we can expect this to be a trend among platforms, DeFi Projects, and Social Currencies.

As of right now, $SKULL rewards are 20,000 $SKULL Distributed monthly, proportionately amongst the pool, with various NFT drops. 

The <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeC346627bA83b471d5ab171618274c5333F9f37">$SKULL Grant Farm</a> has some Liquid Skull in it, and by the end of January '21, I am going to distribute those Liquid rewards as an award to someone who completes a skill building challenge for January. 

<b>The January '21 $SKULL Challenge:</b>

Kickstarter has a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/make-100?ref=make100-homepage-banner">Make/100 Challenge</a>, and I'm going to Paint 100 SKULLS, and weave it into a project which is launched on Kickstarter for that month. 

I'm also going to take the 100 Skulls, and turn them into an NFT Collection via the ERC 1155 Beta on Opensea. 

The collection will be sold through a series of rounds [as above] with a profit share Ratio:
* 30% will return to me. 
* 70% will be contributed to the Grant Farm of the Contributor's Choice.

I will lead this project, and on the 31st of January, I will distribute the Liquid Grant Value of $SKULL available in the Grant Farm Wallet. 

First Time Challenge participants / winners, will not be required to use a profit share method.

<b>Grant Farm Objectives for the January $SKULL Challenge:</b>
* To increase the skill levels of the artists who participate in the challenge, as well as their business skills. I'd like to see the grant funds go out to <b>1-3 People</b>. 
* To increase the base assets of the $SKULL Grant Farm by providing .3 ETH worth of liquidity to the Farm. 

Current Value of the $SKULL Grant Farm: 
* 5146 $SKULL
* 1 $ETH

Current Liquid Grant Funds in $SKULL Grant Farm: 
* 2214 $SKULL
