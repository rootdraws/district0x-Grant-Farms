<h3><b>Use Case #1: A Gardener Grows & Manages their $BAEPAY Community Garden Plot.</b></h3> [FEB: 2021]

$BAEPAY has a number of assets for their business: 

* They Have <a href="https://www.fomamag.com/">FOMA Mag</a>, which is an excellent indie run publication. 
* They have an extensive <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=N@187W,103N">Cryptovoxels Gallery</a>.
* They have a regular email newsletter with interviews on highlighted artists. 
* They have a platform with a marketplace - <a href="https://www.blockchainartexchange.co.uk/">Blockchain Art Exchange [BAE]</a>.
* They have their own Currency, with <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa14c40b83885e1f8d516e0e43a7361f31eca6854#balances">Liquidity Providers.</a> 
* They offer their Liquiditiy Providers Rewards <a href="https://blockchainartex.medium.com/baepay-the-first-real-reward-token-b23b10c96965">outlined in this whitepaper.</a>

BAE still suffers from: 

* Lack of adoption of their platform, in the face of competition with major platforms.
* Lack of financial support for their marketing endeavors. 
* Seeking Growth for their Uniswap Pools. 

<a href="SaschaBailey">Sascha Bailey</a> is offering Liquidty Provider Rewards each month for the next ~ 2 years to combat these issues. This is an opportunity for investors to contribute to the <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xa14c40b83885e1f8d516e0e43a7361f31eca6854">Uniswap BAEPAY - ETH Pool.</a> 

In return for providing this Liquidity, the BAE Avatar, <a href="https://twitter.com/baepaychan">@baepaychan</a>, distributes:
* 20,000 $BAEPAY each week, proportionately to all $BAEPAY Pools, and then proportionately to the Liquidity Providers in the Pool.
* A little bit of ETH Each Month to the top 15 Slots in the Liquidity Provider Holder Hierarchy. 
* The Occasional Rare NFT.

A "Community Garden Plot" is simply a separate wallet with its own keys that has made a contribution to the BAEPAY - ETH liquidity pool, such that the "Harvest" from this contribution consists of as many LP Rewards as possible from that garden. At the time of my writing this, I have created a <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xE476C37a862c6603D3179Aa8b10114590Dc1fcfe">$BAEPAY Grant Farm</a> which qualifies for all three of those rewards. 

This means that the assets that I am able to use for my $BAEPAY Community Challenges [The Harvest], is <b>a weekly deposit of $BAEPAY, a monthly $ETH Deposit,</b> and <b>some NFTs.</b> 

<h3>Scaling this Solution:</h3> 

DeFi Community Gardens, is a District0x themed community support project, which aims to support projects by training artists to become Community Gardeners, invested in growing the liqudity pools of projects of their choosing, while simultaniously organizing community challenges and art collections for those projects. 

A <b>Grant Farm</b> is a purposeful contribution toward a project's Liquidity Pool, designed to leverage liquidity provider rewards as grant funds for community challenges.

The way it works is simple: 

An Artist [or Community Gardener] looks at BAE, and thinks of a community event that would benefit the $BAEPAY Holders, and then organizes one. 

A community challenge that I will be organizing in February is a Challenge to create a small comic about the BAE avatar, <a href="https://twitter.com/baepaychan">@baepaychan</a>, and use the sales from that NFT Collection to help grow my own $BAEPAY Grant Farm.  

This event is designed by a Community Gardener as a challenge that they lead, where they design an NFT Collection meant to be sold via Opensea using $BAEPAY [or any ERC-20 Project Token].

Depending on the amount of resources that this Community Gardener has to share [the size of their plots], they can afford to offer up different amounts of rewards as incentives for joining challenge. 

[These are the LP Rewards distributed weekly, based on the size of the Garden Plot.]

The Community Challenges are Executed. 
A Substantial amount of profits are channelled into the Grant Farm, and the Community Gardener gets to take a small harvest as well.  
* [Ex: 30% Profits to Artist. 70% profits go back into that Gardener's $BAEPAY Community Garden Plot.]

Then, It's onto the next challenge - Either for $BAEPAY, or for another project that the Gardener is passionate about -- and all the while, each plot that the Gardener maintains continues to grow, as long as the Liquidity Provider Reward Agreements are honored, or until they expire. 

<h3> Outcomes:</h3>

<b>The Outcomes for the Artist:</b>

* The Artist builds skills for project management and execution. 
* The Artist builds a collector base, and involves them in a project goal larger than themselves.
* The Artist switches their production focus from unfocused one-off NFTs, toward project focused, audience targeted, NFT Collections. 
* The Artist diversifies their token portfolio, and learns what it means to be an institutional investor, working on behalf of other projects in the ecosystem that they deem to be worthy of support. 
* The Artist benefits from a pro-social Wash Trading, where their collections can actually be purchased by the leaders of the projects that they are serving. 

If a project has a budget for purchasing NFTs for liquidity rewards, or a budget for Marketing - [most of them do] - this use case fulfills both of those criteria, which means that it's an easy sell for the controller of the currency for that project, and a win for the artists who do public fundraising rounds, and get to announce increased sales and partnerships.

<b>The Outcomes for Collectors:</b>

* Instead of endless artsits dropping "Hot #Cryptoart NFTs", sales are now seen as community contributions, which allows collectors in the ETH Market to plug into that artist, because they also support the causes which the artist is raising funds to support.
* If I am invested in $BAEPAY, and an artist comes along and says, "I'm creating a challenge event for $BAEPAY, and X% of profits are going to be channeled into a Community Garden Plot which funds furture Challenges!" -- I am going to interpret what that artist is doing as someone who is adding value to the ecosystem, and to that project. 
* Collectors in ETH Cryptoart are attracted to innovative applications for cryptoart -- if an artist is seen as a community support figure, and an innovator, perhaps their speculative investment in that NFT they bought will appreciate. 


<b>The Outcomes for the Project:</b>

* The Project is distributing these liquidity rewards regardless. In this way, they are distributing them toward an account that actually wants to leverage them for the benefit of their community. 
* The Project recieves a 'pillar of support', as long as the liquidity rewards are being distributed to the grant - because the incentive for the grant farms is not to cash out liquidity when the market is high. the function of the grant farms is to harvest the LP Rewards, which are the dividends of the initial investment. 

This ought to motivate token issuers to generate compelling, and tiered LP rewards, in order to incentivize Gardeners to Grow their Plots, in order to unlock higher LP rewards. 

* In the ultimate case of a highly successful challenge, we have the $LINK Marines effect, where a wave of cryptoart overtakes the social media presence of the moment, fueling a FOMO Craze, which PROPELLS the whole community TO THE MOON. 

Well Done Gardeners, this is the equivalent of the <b>Super Pumpkin</b>.

[Of course, in smaller segments, this may also be possible just by introducing more quality artists [marketers] and collectors [investors] to their community via the challenge.]

[And in the line of "Super Pumpkin" I think awards can be issued for meeting certain milestones in project achievement.]
