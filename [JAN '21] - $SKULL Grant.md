<h3><b>Use Case #0: A Gardener Grows & Manages their $SKULL Community Garden Plot using a Kickstarter Community Challenge!</b></h3> [JAN: 2021]

$SKULL Introduced <a href="https://beta.cent.co/skeenee/+mr2ow2">Liquidity Mining</a> officially in Dec '20, but they have been offering a DIY version through the $SKULL Discord, and announcements on Cent.

$SKULL is also a leader in the <a href="https://tryroll.com/">ROLL Community</a>, and they featured an announcement of $SKULL's Liquidity Rewards in their most recent <a href="https://mailchi.mp/86252b8beae0/roll-update-6103385">Newsletter</a>. I am informed that Roll will be issuing a Liquidity Mining tool in Q1 of 2021, which means we can expect this to be a trend among platforms, DeFi Projects, and Social Currencies.

As of right now, $SKULL rewards are 20,000 $SKULL Distributed monthly, proportionately amongst the pool, with various NFT drops. 

The <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeC346627bA83b471d5ab171618274c5333F9f37">$SKULL Grant Farm</a> has some Liquid Skull in it, and by the end of January '21, I am going to distribute the $SKULL from the LP Rewards to 1-3 people who complete a skill building challenge for January. 

<b>The January '21 $SKULL Challenge:</b>

Kickstarter has a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/make-100?ref=make100-homepage-banner">Make/100 Challenge</a>, and I'm going to Paint 100 Skulls, and weave them into a project which is launched on Kickstarter for that month. 

I'm also going to take the 100 Skulls, and turn them into an NFT Collection via the ERC-1155 Beta on Opensea. 

The collection will be sold through a series of rounds [as above] with a Profit Share Business Model:
* 30% of Profits to me. 
* 70% of Profits will be contributed to the Grant Farm of the Collector's Choice.

In using the Opensea Beta, my costs will be largely reduced. I have put ETH out of pocket into the $SKULL Grant Farm, and will recover that investment.

I will lead this project, and on the 31st of January, I will distribute the Liquid Grant Value of $SKULL available in the Grant Farm Wallet. 

First Time Challenge participants / winners, will not be required to use a profit share method.

<b>Grant Farm Objectives for the January $SKULL Challenge:</b>
* Recover .5475 $ETH Investment into the $SKULL Grant Farm, bringing the operation into the black.
* Distribute 2214 $SKULL in Grant Rewards to 1-3 Challengers. 
* Contribute .3 ETH worth of liquidity to the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeC346627bA83b471d5ab171618274c5333F9f37">$SKULL Grant Farm</a>. 

Current Value of the $SKULL Grant Farm: 
* 5146 $SKULL
* 1 $ETH
* 2214 $SKULL [Liquid Funds]
