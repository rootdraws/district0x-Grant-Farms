<h3><b>Use Case #3 EcoSystem Integrations: In Which GITCOIN Requests a ROBOT!!!.</b></h3>

In March '21, Root Organizes for the #MARCHOFROBOTS Twitter Challenge, and as a result, <a href="https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1330658059396399104">a collection of Creative Commons Zero Robots</a> is created.

As you can see in the linked Tweet above, there is a demand for CC0 Robots.

If Root also leverages his <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x77B0F6AB601C6a5B0741CD5B977BB1AaA1794e3e">$KLTR Community Garden Plot</a>, then perhaps he can create a community challenge that motivates other artists to create collections of CC0 Robots. 

<a href="https://twitter.com/owocki">@Owocki</a> is thrilled. 
PIcture a NFT Market FLOODED with CC0 Robot related projects / collections, and GITCOIN gets the pick of the litter, along with the ability to use them for training modules, reward NFTs, or Cute T-Shirts to support the GITCOIN Mission. 

Gold stars for all. 

Rewards for Participating:

* Gitcoin Grant Matches, since the project serves them and qualifies as Public Goods, due to Creative Commons Zero Licensing.
* Profit Share on NFT Sales of Robot Collections [70% of Profits are Donated to the GITCOIN Campaign of the Artist's Choice. 30% of Profits go to Artist.]  [Clarify here that the percentages are up to the artist - and list "no less than x% if you want to direct a majority or significant amount of funds, or stnadardize.]
* The $KLTR Grant Incentive from the $KLTR Community Garden Plot. 

In the case of the <b>HARVEST FESTIVAL</b>, something similar could occur. 

[If there is no Meta Garden, there is no harvest festival.]

A solution to some issues may be to make any collections that are for GITCOIN multi-editions, and then gifting the first editions to GITCOIN, and then selling the others. 
This way, Gitcoin Gets Robots, and Artwork, and the participating artists get Grant Funds, and Sales. 

[Clarify to minimize voting, Funds from Harvest Festival Metagarden Money.]
[Who has the keys to the metagarden?]
[Brady I'm not sure about this metagarden, cause I don't know who manages it or how the money is determined or what projects etc.]

Maybe if the community gardens are successful the metagarden can develop.

Start with small individual soviergnty projects, and then we can avoid the governance issues of the metagarden.

Also, what if multi-sig fails and people steal from the Meta garden?
