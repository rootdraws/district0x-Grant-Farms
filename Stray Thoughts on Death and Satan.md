<h3><b>Use Case #4 Economic Integrations: The Bridge to the FIAT Art World.</b></h3>

<b>Problem:</b> 

Suppose that you're too poor to give a percentage of your profits to a Community Garden?

I personally believe that this is the future of NFT Artwork, and is going to create a differentiated class of artists -- those who are willing to sacrifice and adapt, in order to become in demand and affiliated, and provide value -- and those who continue to attempt to create value by pursuing their muse. I don't have bones with the latter artist, I just find that it's easier to serve a target audience, and advertisement as artwork is a longstanding source of revenue. This is a conscious move in that direction, using the tools that are available to assist the projects that are qualified and capable of assisting Gardeners through LP Rewards. 

I see LP Rewards as a trend game, and an experiment, and the trend appears to be NFT Collections and Social Currency Issuance Stimulus in the early years. These Garden Plots capitalize on both, while also providing value to the community in question in a way that nobody else is doing except for the leader of the community themselves -- and often they are so busy they don't have time for this sort of thing. 

That is why Major projects such as Distric0x or Makersplace or Superrare or Colony etc. have Community Managers. 

Community Gardeners are essentially Free Agent Community Managers who use Profit Sharing Structures and DeFi LP Rewards to Incentivize Community Growth for target audiences. 

A Garden Plot is not a one off move - it's a growing commitment with a select group of projects who opt in to partner with a gardener. 

Community Gardeners are transforming their business model to be a Community Builder and Project Leader as well as Artists, but they may end up doing it part time for a handful of communities, instead of one.

<b>Answers:</b>

* If this is still a problem - Don't become a Community Gardener. This path of Cryptoart is really more Artist as Marketer and Community Builder, and if you want to take your chances mimicking what other successful artists are doing, with the hopes that you'll end up on Superrare, then by all means, pursue that avenue. 
* If this is a problem, but you're interested in becoming a gardener still - Learn How to Fiat. 

Fiat Art Markets are super competitive, but there are ways to fortify and subsidize your business if you operate in a project based structure, using Fiat Currency. 

<b>Example:</b> 

In January '21, Root will Harvest his <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeC346627bA83b471d5ab171618274c5333F9f37">$SKULL Community Garden</a> to support participation in a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/make-100?ref=make100-homepage-banner">Make / 100 Kickstarter Challenge</a>.

Every January, Kickstarter proposes a challenge to the general community of project executors -- "Make 100 of a THING and sell it." 

They are extremely broad in what make 100 and whath THING means. 

In January, Root will Make 100 Paintings of a SKULL, for a $SKULL Network Challenge. This means that these 100 Paintings will be valid for the following monetization strategies:
* Kickstarter Make / 100 Campaign 
* Patreon
* 100 NFT Collection of SKULLS [30% of Profits go to Root and 70% of Profits go to the $SKULL Grant Farm.]

[address non-specific percentages again, percentages are up to the individual with minimum guides of contribution toward projects.]
 
The Challenge for that month will also require a Successful Kickstarter Campaign, in addition to creating a 100 Collection. 

In this way, we see money coming into the Artist's life, in addition to the pro-community work they are doing for the projects they are associated with. 

It may also be the case that each Community Gardener and each associated Project Community sees an influx of new collectors from the exposure from the FIAT art world, or even new FIAT Artists onboarding, as now these challenges may be equally compelling to both Cryptoartists, and Fiat Artists. 

I will be doing a Kickstarter Campaign, and Patreon Art Share for every Monthly Challenge I execute in 2021, and while the challenges I create won't demand a Kickstarter specific campaign, they will require some form of Fiat Monetization.  

<b>TOKENOMICS BONUS!</b>
With Sales pressure decreased, due to external support for paying bills, you are now free to look at your personal stash of $SKULL [or any other token], with the patient and practiced eye of a long term investor, rather than constant sell pressure, which drives down price.

<h3><b>Use Case #5 ORDO CIVITAS ARATOREM [O.C.A] - [The Secret Society of Master Gardeners.]</b></h3>

But all of this is sort of complex, and I'm not sure I want to participate, or that people will want to participate, I mean it seems like a lot.

The ORDO CIVITAS ARATOREM is here to challenge you to explore  you the ways of the Master Gardeners. 

To be a Community Gardener, you must execute your own challenges, take care of your plots, and contribute to the META Garden. [deleted if there is no metagarden.]

To be a MASTER Community Gardener, the road is full of achievement based challenges, which unlock NFT Badges, which provide exclusive access to a Discord Server. [Via Collabland]

This server can also have a Collectors' section, where the collectors who support your project, and the leaders of the communities you are supporting with your project can be issued NFTs which also allow them a place in this server. 

What you end up creating here is: 
* a tiered form of accomplishment and ascension, which leads toward an increased understanding of how to effectively execute and grow these plots
* an aggregated collection of collectors that are supportive of each challenge
* an aggregated alliance of Project Leads who all benefit from, and contribute to the existence of the Community Gardens, by providing their Liquidity Rewards.

Access provides you with collaborative opportunities, a targeted shiling channel, Status and DAO VOTE!

[If nyxing this section because I don't want work load, then proposed challenges will take up time, and the achievement badge award system, would take up a significant amount of time, which I may want to just spend creating and executing my own projects. I don't want a time suck. Not sure if it's something to include now - if community gardens are successful, it might be something to do in the future, along with the metagarden idea. ]

.:. 

VOTING: 

The majority of the Community Gardens is a decentralized project, run by individual Gardeners, which means that there is only 1 major issue which must be decided on each year, and that is - how exactly will HARVEST FESTIVAL Funds be allocated / distributed for that year. 

If you are a Master Gardener, you ought to get a token, which you can use to vote via <a href="https://snapshot.page/#/">Snapshot</a>.

Collectors can be involved in individual governance issues per project goverened by each Community Gardener. 

EXAMPLE: 

A collector of mine just purchased two of the ALICE Collection for ETH, and then when asked which farm they wanted me to contribute their Grant funds toward, they replied via Tweet $BAEPAY, and Complimented Sascha. 

This is an example of Collectors being involved in a 'local level' grant fund allocation. 

It may also be of benefit for each community gardener to operate their own governance token structure, so that they can manage disputes or ties or what have you, in their challenges - however, this is not really the business of the Community Gardens. 

The Community Gardens only real concerns are:
* How the HARVEST FESTIVAL Harveest funds are allocated toward the annual challenge?
* Whether to Remove Liquidity for a garden plot [community rugpull feature, or if LP Rewards expire.] -- In this situation, the ETH Can go to every other project within the META Garden, and the Masters can vote on its distribution -- and the currency remaining can be distributed in a lump sum at the Harvest Festival for that year.

<h3><b>Expansion Possibility #1 EcoSystem Integrations: Okay, but what if they were GAardeners...your Aavegotchi could be like a little Community GAardener!!!.</b></h3>

* This works well, because it's another point of connection to a healthy community -- Which Aavegotchi supports.
* It fits with the pro-social ethos of Aavegotchi, and the Defi ethos of Aave. 
* And Aavegotchis have land coming up -- we really ought to be able to build community gardens on that land for these Grant Projects. 

I see this as a longer term development possibility, but I think it's cool, and I like how Aavegotchis can be used to transmit value in NFTs. They are basically little NFT Tradable Grant Farms. 

.:. 

Conclusion: 

Basically, the dynamics are here - we just need a UX that shows the health of the various META Gardens, as well as the individual health of each Gardener's Plots. 

So Root's Garden Plots: 

Ought to be a page. 

And anybody ought to be able to see the health / balances / Liquidity Awards of each plot. 

.:. 

We also need a basic Challenge Formula / announcement banner / promise. So, when I say "I have created a challenge with this X Plot, here are the parameters of success," then people know not only cause of my tweets, but also because of the promise on the Community Garden's Page. 

.:. 

We'll also need Collabland organization and some NFTs for the Discord, as well as an initial list of Tiers for accomplishments for gardeners to unlock. 

.:. 

There also may be a better way to create the META Garden pools, though I don't know what that looks like. Probably some Solidity Magick there. 

.:. 

Upon further reflection, it seems like I ought to execute these challenges myself first, before creating a community, and DAO fund, because I only want to manage a community like that with other competent people who share responsibility for that leadership, and alleviate the load of responsibilities needed in order to make this project a remarkable training tool. 

I think that the ideas behind this system are pieces that I'd like to explore once I develop my own iteration of these projects first more throughly. I would also like to have some kind of partner or team to help orchestrate and execute things, because 

Being a Community Gardener, is likely a full time job. 
In addition to that, orchestrating the Community Gardeners -- seems like one of those positions that you don't really think is a position, but then it is, because you end up having to explain lots of things or train people, or resolve disputes, or whatever else. 

I think I may have gotten excited about the possibilities for the project, when it may be best for me to just focus on executing my own community garden plots, outside of the context of this larger utility.  12/9/2020.

<h3><b>Use Case #2: A Gardener Grows & Manages their $SKULL Community Garden Plot, while Seeding the META Garden.</b></h3>

In order to Participate in the District0x Community Gardens, each gardner will need to contribute a small percentage of ETH and the currency of their latest Harvest to the <b>META Garden.</b>

The META Garden is a DAO Governed Treasury made up of Liquidity Pools with Active LP Reward Systems. The variety of Liquidity Pools will be as many different varieties as there are plots in the larger garden. 

Once a year, the META Garden is harvested, and we celebrate the <b>Harvest Festival!</b>

<b>Example:</b>

Root Cultivates his <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeC346627bA83b471d5ab171618274c5333F9f37">$SKULL Community Garden Plot</a> with 8 Harvests a year.
Each Harvest, he contributes more to the Plot, growing it in size, and maybe even qualifying for greater $SKULL LP Rewards.
* <a href="https://beta.cent.co/skeenee/+hhaemj">Oct '20 $SKULL Report details LP Reward levels for $SKULL Pools.</a>

Each time Root has a harvest, he knows that seeding the META Garden is important, because each year during the <b>HARVEST FESTIVAL</b>, the Yield from the META Garden is used to support a challenge focused on creating Creative Commons Zero Artwork designed to support GITCOIN / GITCOIN projects. 

What this essentially means, is that each art community that is being lead in challenges by a Community Gardener, will be targeting their community funds, as rewards, for participating in a GITCOIN Focused Challenge. 

The Harvest Festival is a great mythic time, where the Hero Slays Moloch, God of Coordination Failure.  

Over time, the META Garden will increase in size and capacity, essentially providing yet another pillar of stability to each of these projects that provide Liquidity Rewards, and due to the collective nature of the META Garden, that 20 ETH Liquidity Reward for the SKULL - ETH Pool may become a bit more within reach. 

Visit @Skeenee's <a href="https://beta.cent.co/skeenee/+mr2ow2">November Blog Post for Updates on his Liquidity Pool Reward System,</a> Now including NFT Mining!

[Clarify here about the percentages being up to each individual gardener, and also that the metagarden source comes from the grant funds portion.]

.:. 

Additional thoughts were discovered today about shared liquidity pools: 
* The LP Tokens can be collected into an account which then would become the metagarden. So, If I raise 4 LP Tokens for a project during a given month, and I give .25 LP Tokens into the Meta Garden, and someone else is working with the same LP Tokens on another project, and they contribute .25 LP Tokens, then the Metagarden now has a garden worth .5 LP Tokens of that particular garden. 

If we do that again next month, then the Metagarden now has 1 LP Token worth. 

This is how the metagarden accumulates over time. 

.:. 

For Governance, you will still need a Snapshot or an Aragon entity, and you will need to have a Treasury person - preferably with multi-sig. I will have to learn more about aragon. 

.:. 

Also, I can use Colony to establish training modules for the Challenges, and if a challenger completes the challenges, I can issue them an NFT for that challenge which gives them access to an exclusive server. 

In this way, I only have to create the training module Once, and I only have to issue the Tokens once per completion. 
This would significantly decrease the amount of time spent. 
I don't want to commit to doing this yet, because I don't know how much time exists, and I'd rather just focus on executing the project.
